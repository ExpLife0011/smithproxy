##Building from sources:##
If you want to build smithproxy from sources, feel free. Current setup is done the way that you have to have socle and smithproxy
directories in the same folder.  
I am using simple script which makes it easy (I am just editing it):

```
#!shell

# cat fetch.sh
SMITHPROXY_USER="astibal"
SMITHPROXY_BRANCH="0.4"
SOCLE_USER="astibal"
SOCLE_BRANCH="0.1"

git clone git@bitbucket.org:${SMITHPROXY_USER}/smithproxy.git -b ${SMITHPROXY_BRANCH}
git clone git@bitbucket.org:${SOCLE_USER}/socle.git -b ${SOCLE_BRANCH}
```
1. adjust the above and run it
2. go to smithproxy/build  (you can create build directory if necessary)
3. run 'cmake .. && make'
4. if you have all dependencies installed, you will see smithproxy executable in the build/.
