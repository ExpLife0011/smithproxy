/*
 now let's override baseProxy, and use on_left/right_bytes method!
 this proxy is working with *already accepted* sockets

 basically Proxy class recognizes LEFT and RIGHT side. You can organize those contexts on both sides.
 it's up to you what will do with them, it doesn't have any particular technical meaning; it just 
 follows the principle that you are usually proxying 2 sides (most commonly clients with servers, but 
 left-right is more generic and follows common sense.
